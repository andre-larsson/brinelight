# Brinelight: game notes

Working notes for whoever picks this up next. Player-facing rules are in README.md; commands are in AGENTS.md.

## Where this came from

- Brinelight was one of two builds made from the same brief (an original roguelike deckbuilder inspired by Slay the Spire) in a blind test. Both builds landed on a lighthouse keeper and a tide gauge.
- The user slightly preferred this one. The other build's first fight felt drawn out: it had raised enemy HP about 1.5x so the tide had time to play out, and weakened the starting attacks.
- The user's feedback, which applied to this build too: functional and nice-looking, but flat visual hierarchy (many equally weighted elements and texts), small text, and crucial rules buried in a long How to Play page. They asked for a tutorial that teaches the basics (HP on both sides, attacking, Ward on both sides, the Tide, how many cards you draw and how the discard pile comes back) before the game's own mechanics.

## Decisions the user made

- Keep this build's rules and balance. Don't retune them.
- Add a guided first fight (tutorial).
- Do a layout and text-size pass.
- Add rule tests and a UI smoke test so later changes are safe.

## Provisional calls (made without the user; each can be judged and undone on its own)

1. **Soaked bug fix changes difficulty a little.** Enemy intents counted the keeper's Soaked, but the keeper's Soaked wore off at the end of the keeper's own turn, before enemies attacked, so enemy-applied Soaked never did anything and intents overstated hits (Hollow Siren's Shriek showed 7x2 and dealt 5x2). Now the keeper's Soaked lasts through the following enemy turn, as the rules, tooltip and intent say. Bot win rate over 1000 seeds went 27.3% -> 21.1%; extra damage per fight: Hollow Siren +3.0, Angler Twins +2.3, Bellwether +2.2; normal fights unchanged. Alternative that keeps the old balance exactly: leave the decay where it was and make intents ignore Soaked that will wear off (Soaked on the keeper would then do nothing). Revert commit "Fix: Soaked on the keeper wore off before enemies attacked" to undo.
2. **Tutorial form:** a scripted guided fight with a pointing bubble and a spotlight ring, 16 steps, about 2 minutes. Wrong cards, wrong targets and early End Turns are blocked with a short reason.
3. **Tutorial content:** Barnacle Mite (12 HP) and Brine Crab (24 HP, hardens for 4 Ward on turn 1), a fixed 13-card deck drawn in order, no Tide-Bell (so hands stay fixed). The reshuffle really happens at the start of turn 3; Storm Surge's double Crest is the finishing blow.
4. **When it's offered:** on the first New Descent ("First dive?" with Play / Skip), not on the title screen. Also a Tutorial button on the title and in the menu. Leaving it mid-way marks it "skipped"; finishing marks it "done". Either way it isn't offered again.
5. **First-time hints:** once ever each, one at a time, a dark bubble with "Got it". They cover the map, Dreads, rewards, the shop, rests, tonics, the Tide-Bell, the lethal warning, Sink/Float/Rite/Echo cards, and each status. A hint is marked seen as soon as it shows and closes when you leave that screen.
6. **Removed:** the old one-off Crest tip in the first fight, and How to Play opening by itself on the first run.
7. **How to Play** is five short tabs (Basics, The Tide, Keywords, The map, Controls). The story paragraph was dropped from it (it's on the title screen). Echo was added to the glossary.
8. **Fight screen hierarchy:** larger, darker-backed intents; taller HP bars with 14px numbers; bigger Ward badges and status chips. The HUD hides its HP during fights (it's on the keeper's bar) and quiets Pearls and Depth. The keeper's name label is gone.
9. **End Turn** is a quiet button that turns amber (and pulses) only when nothing is playable.
10. **Tide bar:** lighter segments, the duplicate "Tide N" label removed (the lit segment shows the number).
11. **Hand cards:** smaller art panel and 12px+ text. The Attack/Skill pill is hidden on hand cards (the border colour still shows the type). On phones, card text wraps inside the part of the card the next card doesn't cover, and the fan is flatter.
12. **Map:** reachable stops carry a text label (Skirmish, Fog, Dread, Shop, Cove, Wreck).
13. **Reward screen:** the card choice comes first and largest; Pearls and bonuses are one row of chips. The title is now "Victory" (was "The deep goes quiet").
14. **Landscape phones:** smaller sprites when the field is short so intents, HP and statuses all fit.

## Measurements (latest)

- **First real fight** (rules unchanged), bot over 500 seeds, median / p90:
  - careful bot (blocks whenever damage would get through): 5 / 6 turns, 17 / 22 actions, 30 / 39 taps on a phone;
  - aggressive bot (attacks first): 3 / 4 turns, 10 / 14 actions, 18 / 25 taps.
  - Animation time in the browser at normal speed, instant decisions: median 12.5 s.
  - Estimated play time with thinking (3.5 s a card, 1.5 s an End Turn, between the two bots): about 54 s.
- **Tutorial fight:** 16 steps = 6 Next taps + 8 card plays + 2 End Turns (24 taps on a phone). 253 words of bubble text. Estimated about 2 minutes (about 100 s reading at 180 wpm, 13 s tapping, 8 s animation).
- **Time to the end of the first real fight:** about 1 minute without the tutorial, about 3 minutes with it.
- **Readability:** rendered text below 12px over every screen at 1280x800, 390x844, 360x640 and 844x390: 161 elements before the interface pass, 1 after (a rotated card measured at 11.7px).
- **Bot run outcomes** (careful bot, 1000 seeds): win 21.1%, average depth 10.5 of 11. Bots aren't people: use these for before/after comparisons, not as difficulty targets.

## Tools

- `tests/rules.test.js`: every rule in README.md and How to Play, plus determinism and save/continue. `tests/tutorial.test.js`: the scripted tutorial fight.
- `tests/ui-smoke.js`: headless Chrome through the real UI (desktop mouse and keyboard, phone touch, tutorial with mouse, touch and keyboard, tutorial from inside a run). Checks for JS errors, stuck screens, horizontal overflow, Continue, the keeper's incoming number and End Turn lighting up.
- `tools/bot.js`: loads the engine in Node and plays runs with a deterministic policy.
- `tools/opening.js`: the opening measurements above.
- `tools/screens.js`: screenshots of every screen at the four sizes, plus the small-text list. `tools/tutorial-shots.js`: one screenshot per tutorial step.
- `tools/serve.js`, `tools/cdp.js`: static server and a tiny Chrome DevTools client (launches its own headless Chrome on a free port).
- `tools/build.js`: assembles `_site/` for Pages and checks every referenced file exists.

## Determinism and saves

- All game randomness goes through a mulberry32 RNG whose state lives in the run (`run.rng`), so a save restores it exactly. Same seed and same decisions give the same run; tested, including a save/reload mid-fight.
- `Math.random` is used only for a fresh seed and in the UI (music, particles, float positions).
- The tutorial is a separate run object (`run.tutorial`) that is never saved and never scores. A run in progress is saved before the tutorial starts and reloaded after.
- localStorage keys: `brinelight.save.v1`, `brinelight.prefs.v1`, `brinelight.best.v1`, `brinelight.maxlevel.v1`, `brinelight.tutorial.v1`, `brinelight.hints.v1`. Every project site on the Pages origin shares storage, so keep the `brinelight.` prefix on anything new.

## Art

- Painterly underwater scenes: teal deep water, warm lantern and brass highlights, creatures and objects on transparent backgrounds for units. All images are WebP in `img/`.
- No new images were generated in this pass. Nothing is queued.

## Open questions for the next playtest

- Could you play the first real fight without opening How to Play?
- Is the tutorial too long? Which bubbles felt unnecessary?
- On the fight screen, what did you look at first?
- On a phone, can you read the hand without raising each card?
- Does End Turn staying quiet until you're out of moves help, or did you look for it?
- Do the Hollow Siren, the Angler Twins and the Bellwether feel noticeably harder (Soaked fix)?
